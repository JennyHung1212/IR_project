I'm a student study Information Management at National Taiwan University. I love coding and problem solving. I'm now working on a project of digitalization and optimization of the scheduling system. We used Django as the framework, Bootstrap as the main template and also HTML, css, javascript, python etc. At the beginning of this project, we met with our clients and discuss their needs and the rules of the scheduling problem. We are a group of 7 people, and are separated in two small groups. The first one is the algorithm team, whose main task is to develop the most suitable algorithms for the scheduling problem. The second group is the web system group, who are responsible for building the web system, maintaining the database and UI/UX design. I think the hardest part of the whole project is debugging. The unknown, mysterious would kill you trust me. I'm a group-working person and have the ability to communicate and cooperate with others. The reason why we chose Django over php or other framework is that Django implement the MVC model, and use Python as the backend language which we are familiar with. We also found that Javascript and Ajax is quite useful for building a responsive website, which can enhance user experience.
I would love to be a front-end programmer in the future.
